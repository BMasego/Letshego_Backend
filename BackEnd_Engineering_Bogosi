Wrote a Spring Boot Java application with test cases, which exposes an API such that given a 
bill, it finds the net payable amount. Noted the stress is on object oriented approach 
and test coverage. User interface is not specified, only an API exposed.

API documentation used ContentFul procedures below defined

Authentication : You access the API securely via HTTPS, and it will be available to clients authenticating with an access token.
Resource IDs : When creating resources, you can specify an ID or let the API generate a random ID for you.
Updating content : Contentful doesn't merge changes made to content, so when updating content, you need to send the entire body of an entry.

X-Contentful-RateLimit-Reset: 0
